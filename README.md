# simstack
SIMSTACK for Python

An open-source, Python version of SIMSTACK. 
For those familiar with the IDL version, viero_quick_stack is a similar wrapper to the stack_in_redshift_slices function.  
This python code is intended to be object oriented, with map objects (containing maps, noisemaps, beams, color corrections, etc.) and catalog objects (with RA/DEC lists for different selection criteria) collected into libraries, and SIMSTACK performed with one line of code.  

Hopefully, with community input (which I encourage!) the code will grow in utility.
